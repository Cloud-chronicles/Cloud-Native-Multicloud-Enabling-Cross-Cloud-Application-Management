# Architecture
The architecture of this multicloud solution is designed to provide a consistent management experience across multiple cloud environments. It leverages the power of AWS Outposts, Azure Arc, and Google Anthos to enable organizations to deploy and manage applications across different cloud providers.

## High-level Design
The overall design of the solution consists of the following components:

* Management Layer: This layer is responsible for the overall management of the multicloud environment. It includes the tools and interfaces used to deploy, manage, and monitor applications across different cloud providers.
* Application Layer: This layer consists of the applications that are deployed and run across the multicloud environment. The applications are containerized and deployed using Kubernetes.
* Infrastructure Layer: This layer consists of the underlying infrastructure that supports the management and application layers. It includes the virtual networks, storage resources, and other infrastructure components required to run the multicloud environment.

## Management Layer
The management layer is based on the use of AWS Outposts, Azure Arc, and Google Anthos to provide a consistent management experience across multiple cloud environments. The layer includes the following components:

* AWS Outposts: Used to manage and deploy applications on AWS.
* Azure Arc: Used to manage and deploy applications on Azure.
* Google Anthos: Used to manage and deploy applications on Google Cloud.
* Kubernetes: Used as the container orchestration platform.
* Istio: Used to provide service mesh capabilities

## Application Layer
The application layer consists of the applications that are deployed and run across the multicloud environment. The applications are containerized and deployed using Kubernetes.

## Infrastructure Layer
The infrastructure layer consists of the underlying infrastructure that supports the management and application layers. It includes the following components:

* Virtual Networks: Used to provide network connectivity across the multicloud environment.
* Storage Resources: Used to provide persistent storage for the applications.
* Load Balancers: Used to distribute traffic to the applications.
* Identity and Access Management (IAM): Used to manage access to the multicloud environment.
